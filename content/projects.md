## MarAuth
MarAuth was originally a project called RawRoar, I'm not sure why I originally called it that but that's what it was called. I'm currently hosting it to around 200 people and they seem to like it, although I haven't made anything off of it myself. I hope that other people have used it to their fullest potentinal. It uses MongoDB, Node, and NPM. This is my first project so it isn't very great but it works perfectly and I haven't ran into any errors yet.

## Discord Bot
This is the bot I use for MarAuth, it made me learn discord.js, how to use PM2, and how to insert documents using MongoDB, overall I think it made me gain a lot of my current knowledge.
